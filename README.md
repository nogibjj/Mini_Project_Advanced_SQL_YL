# 706-DE-Mini_Project_Advanced_SQL_YL

## Purpose of the project
This project is an extension on the Week#5 Assignment - SQLite Project.

I used two datasets: one is global alcohol consumption, and the other one is country-to-continent categorization.

## Requirements
- Design a complex SQL query involving joins, aggregation, and sorting
- Provide an explanation for what the query is doing and the expected results


## Grading Criteria

- Query functionality (20 points)
- Explanation and documentation (20 points)
- CI/CD pipeline (10 points)
- README.md (10 points)

## Deliverables

- SQL query
- Written or video explanation of the query
- If you choose a NoSQL database (swap instructions in a way that make sense for your databases)

## Submission 
- Public repository URL
